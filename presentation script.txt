TRIAGELOCK
Saving Lives Through Intelligent Triage

IIT Hyderabad Hackathon 2026 | Team A.I.C.A

🧭 PART 1 — OPENING (1 MIN)
SPEAKER: AMEEN

“In emergency medicine, patients don’t die because doctors lack skill.
They die because the right patient doesn’t reach the right doctor at the right time.”

On 26/11, Mumbai hospitals were overwhelmed.
Doctors were present. Infrastructure existed.
What failed was triage, prediction, and coordination.

This is not history.
This happens every day in Indian emergency rooms.

So we asked one question:

What if hospitals could identify risk before it becomes irreversible?

That question led to TRIAGELOCK.

🧩 PART 2 — THE PROBLEM (1 MIN)
SPEAKER: AMEEN

Emergency departments today face four core failures:

Manual triage

Paper-based, slow

5–10 minutes per patient during surges

No deterioration prediction

Stable patients crash unexpectedly

No early warning system

No surge preparedness

Hospitals react after overload

No forecasting

No system-level visibility

Hospitals operate in silos

Government can’t redirect resources

Result: preventable deaths — despite available care.

🧠 PART 3 — THE SOLUTION (1.5 MIN)
SPEAKER: AMEEN

TRIAGELOCK is a real-time, AI-powered emergency triage and coordination platform.

It operates in three layers:

Layer 1 — Rule-Based Triage (Always On)

Based on ESI, START, Indian EM protocols

Uses vitals, symptoms, risk factors

Instant RED / YELLOW / GREEN

Works even without AI

Layer 2 — AI Enhancement

Predicts patient deterioration

Extracts symptoms from free text (NLP)

Forecasts patient surges 6 hours ahead

Explainable AI using SHAP values

Layer 3 — Real-Time Coordination

WebSocket-based live updates

Auto-escalation for long waits

City-level government dashboard

This is not a concept.
This is built, deployed, and running.

I’ll hand it over to Steve to show you how it works live.

💻 PART 4 — LIVE DEMO (4.5 MIN)
SPEAKER: STEVE

I’ll walk you through TRIAGELOCK from four perspectives:
Nurse, Doctor, Hospital Admin, and Government.

👩‍⚕️ 1. Nurse Perspective

Nurse enters vitals and symptoms

Free-text complaint → AI extracts clinical meaning

Instant triage + risk score + recommendations

Impact:

Triage time reduced from 5–10 minutes to 30 seconds

No clinical detail missed

👨‍⚕️ 2. Doctor Perspective

Priority queue auto-sorted by risk

Deterioration prediction shown clearly

SHAP values explain why risk is high

Real-time re-scoring after treatment

Impact:

Doctors see who will deteriorate next

AI assists, never overrides judgment

🏥 3. Hospital Admin Perspective

Live patient load & bed occupancy

ICU saturation alerts

6-hour surge forecast

Automatic escalation for waiting patients

Impact:

Hospitals prepare before overload

Zero patients fall through the cracks

🏛️ 4. Government Perspective

City-wide hospital visibility

Overload detection

Ambulance redirection recommendations

Impact:

System-level coordination

Faster emergency response across the city

⚙️ PART 5 — TECH CREDIBILITY (1.5 MIN)
SPEAKER: STEVE

This is a production-grade system.

Stack:

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Backend: Node.js + Express

Real-time: WebSockets

AI: Python microservice + SHAP

Database: PostgreSQL (SQLite for demo)

Deployment: Live on Railway

Key Design Principles:

Rule-based fallback → no single point of failure

Explainable AI → clinical trust

Microservices → independent scaling

Full audit trail → compliance ready

Built like a startup product — not a hackathon demo.

📊 PART 6 — IMPACT (1 MIN)
SPEAKER: AMEEN

With TRIAGELOCK:

⏱ 15× faster triage

🚨 Zero missed escalations

🔮 6-hour surge prediction

🏥 City-wide coordination

💰 No additional hardware

But the real impact is human:

Catching deterioration 8 minutes earlier
Preparing hospitals hours earlier
Redirecting ambulances before collapse

That’s how lives are saved.

🔭 PART 7 — VISION & ASK (1 MIN)
SPEAKER: AMEEN
Roadmap

Pilot in one Hyderabad hospital

City-wide rollout

State and national integration (ABDM-ready)

Our Ask

We’re not asking you to imagine the future.
We’re showing you a system that works today.

If deployed tomorrow, TRIAGELOCK would save lives.

🎤 PART 8 — CLOSING (30 SEC)
SPEAKER: AMEEN

TRIAGELOCK is not about AI.
It’s about time, coordination, and accountability.

Other teams built ideas.
We built something deployable.

We are Team A.I.C.A — AI for Critical Aid.
This is TRIAGELOCK.
